## com.kavinschool.exceptions

This package contains custom exception classes used throughout the application. These exceptions are designed to handle specific error conditions and provide meaningful error messages to the users.

## Some of the common exceptions discussed are

- **CustomException**: A base class for all custom exceptions.
- **UserNotFoundException**: Thrown when a user is not found in the system.
- **InvalidInputException**: Thrown when the input provided by the user is invalid.
- **DatabaseException**: Thrown when there is an error related to database operations.

## Usage

These exceptions should be used to handle specific error conditions in the application. By using custom exceptions, you can provide more detailed and user-friendly error messages.

## Example

```java
try {
    // Some code that may throw an exception
} catch (UserNotFoundException e) {
    // Handle user not found exception
} catch (InvalidInputException e) {
    // Handle invalid input exception
} catch (DatabaseException e) {
    // Handle database exception
} catch (CustomException e) {
    // Handle any other custom exceptions
}
finally {
    // Cleanup code
}
```

## Best Practices

- Always provide a meaningful message when throwing an exception.
- Use specific exceptions for specific error conditions.
- Catch and handle exceptions appropriately to ensure the application remains stable.
