# Java Lambdas

This package contains examples of Java Lambda expressions.

## Overview

Java Lambda expressions are a feature introduced in Java 8 that provide a clear and concise way to represent one method interface using an expression. They enable you to treat functionality as a method argument or treat a code as data.

## Examples

- **Basic Lambda Expression**: Demonstrates the syntax and usage of a simple lambda expression.
- **Functional Interfaces**: Shows how lambda expressions can be used with functional interfaces.
- **Stream API**: Examples of using lambda expressions with the Stream API for data processing.
