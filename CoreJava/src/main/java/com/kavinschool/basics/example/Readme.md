# Java Basics Example

This package contains basic examples to help you get started with Java programming. It includes simple programs and demonstrations of fundamental Java concepts.

## Classes

- **ExampleClass1**: This class demonstrates basic input and output operations in Java.
- **ExampleClass2**: This class shows how to use control flow statements like if-else and loops.
- **ExampleClass3**: This class provides examples of basic data structures like arrays and lists.

## Usage

To use the classes in this package, you can run the `main` method in each class. Below are some examples of what you can do with the basic examples in Java:

- Perform basic input and output operations
- Use control flow statements
- Work with basic data structures

## Example

Here is a simple example of a basic Java program:

```java
public class ExampleClass1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
