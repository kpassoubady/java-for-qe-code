## Java Arrays

This package contains classes and examples demonstrating the usage of arrays in Java. Arrays are a fundamental data structure in Java that allow you to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable.

### Classes

- **ArrayExamples**: This class provides various examples of how to create, initialize, and manipulate arrays in Java.

### Usage

To use the classes in this package, you can run the `main` method in each class. Below are some examples of what you can do with arrays in Java:

- Create and initialize arrays
- Access and modify array elements
- Iterate over arrays using loops
- Perform common operations like sorting and searching

### Example

Here is a simple example of how to create and print an array in Java:

```java
public class ArrayExamples {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        for (int number : numbers) {
            System.out.println(number);
        }
    }
}
```

### Additional Resources

For more information on arrays in Java, you can refer to the official [Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/arrays.html).
