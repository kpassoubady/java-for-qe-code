## 1. Designing Testable Classes with Inheritance and Access Modifiers

- **Concept**: Discuss inheritance in Java and how access modifiers (private, protected, public) impact testing, especially for unit tests.
- **Example**:
  - **Banking**: A `BankAccount` class with different types of accounts as subclasses (e.g., `SavingsAccount`, `CheckingAccount`). Access modifiers control how much of the internal workings are exposed to tests and whether inherited behaviors can be tested in isolation.
- **Key Points**:
  - Use `protected` methods for classes designed for extension, allowing testing subclasses.
  - Avoid `private` methods when unit testing is required.

## 2. Leveraging Subclasses and Polymorphism for Effective Testing

- **Concept**: Show how polymorphism allows testing different behaviors under a common interface or superclass.
- **Example**:
  - **Insurance**: An `InsurancePolicy` superclass with specific policies such as `HealthInsurancePolicy`, `LifeInsurancePolicy`. Tests can verify that the correct policy behavior is invoked based on the type of policy.
- **Key Points**:
  - Use polymorphism to test multiple subclasses using a single test.
  - Demonstrate mock testing with polymorphic objects.

## 3. Crafting Mockable Interfaces for Robust Quality Assurance

- **Concept**: Discuss how interfaces allow for mock implementations in tests, facilitating easier unit testing and separation of concerns.
- **Example**:
  - **Stocks**: A `StockService` interface that retrieves stock data, with one implementation using real-time data and another as a mock for testing. Dependency injection allows swapping between them.
- **Key Points**:
  - Design interfaces for services, such as external API calls or complex computations, making them mockable for tests.
  - Demonstrate mock objects in testing frameworks like Mockito.

## 4. The Role of Functional Interfaces in Test-Driven Development

- **Concept**: Introduce functional interfaces and their use in Java's functional programming. Show how they enhance code testability in test-driven development (TDD).
- **Example**:
  - **Technology**: Use a functional interface to define an operation like `TransactionValidator` that accepts different validation strategies (e.g., `AmountValidator`, `CurrencyValidator`) in a financial technology system.
- **Key Points**:
  - Functional interfaces simplify testing by decoupling logic from implementation.
  - Use lambda expressions in tests to provide different behaviors dynamically.

## 5. Abstract Classes: Balancing Flexibility and Testability

- **Concept**: Explore the role of abstract classes, allowing partial implementation while leaving other aspects for subclasses. Show how to effectively test abstract methods and concrete implementations.
- **Example**:
  - **Banking**: A `LoanProcessor` abstract class, with concrete methods for common logic and abstract methods for specific loan types (`HomeLoanProcessor`, `AutoLoanProcessor`). Test the shared logic while mocking abstract parts.
- **Key Points**:
  - Use abstract classes to share logic across classes while enforcing specific implementation in tests.
  - Test partial implementations without creating concrete subclasses.

## 6. Utilizing Static Classes for Utility Functions in Testing

- **Concept**: Explain when and how to use static utility classes for common functionality and the implications for testing, such as global state and test isolation.
- **Example**:
  - **Stocks**: A `StockUtils` class that provides utility functions like `formatStockPrice()` or `calculateGrowth()`. Tests should verify these static methods without depending on instance state.
- **Key Points**:
  - Static methods should be stateless for easier testing.
  - Show examples where static utility functions are preferable to instance methods.

## 7. Dependency Injection: Enhancing Testability and Scalability in Java Applications

- **Concept**: Demonstrate how dependency injection (DI) improves testability by decoupling object creation from object usage. DI frameworks like Spring allow for flexible testing configurations.
- **Example**:
  - **Insurance**: A `ClaimService` that depends on external services like `RiskAssessmentService` and `PolicyValidationService`, both injected via DI. Tests can inject mocks for these services to isolate the `ClaimService` functionality.
- **Key Points**:
  - Dependency injection allows easy swapping of dependencies in tests.
  - Demonstrate DI patterns such as constructor injection and field injection for testable code.

## Practical Exercises

- Implement mock services for banking transactions using dependency injection.
- Create unit tests for polymorphic behaviors in insurance policies.
- Use Mockito to mock external services in a stock-trading system.
