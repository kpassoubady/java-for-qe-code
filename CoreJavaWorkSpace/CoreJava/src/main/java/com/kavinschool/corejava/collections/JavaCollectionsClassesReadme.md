## Java Collections Implementation Classes

Hereâ€™s a table summarizing the main classes in the Java Collections Framework, along with their descriptions:

| **Class**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ArrayList`            | A resizable array implementation of the `List` interface. Provides fast random access but slow for adding/removing elements in the middle of the list.                   |
| `LinkedList`           | A doubly linked list implementation of both `List` and `Deque` interfaces. It provides efficient insertions and deletions from both ends but slower random access.       |
| `HashSet`              | Implements the `Set` interface and backed by a hash table. It does not maintain any order for the elements.                                                              |
| `LinkedHashSet`        | A subclass of `HashSet` that maintains a linked list of the entries in the set, in the order they were inserted.                                                         |
| `TreeSet`              | Implements the `NavigableSet` interface and stores elements in a sorted tree structure. Elements are sorted according to their natural order or by a custom comparator.  |
| `HashMap`              | Implements the `Map` interface and uses a hash table to store key-value pairs. It allows null values and one null key but does not maintain any order.                   |
| `LinkedHashMap`        | Extends `HashMap` and maintains a linked list of the entries in the map, preserving the insertion order.                                                                 |
| `TreeMap`              | Implements the `NavigableMap` interface and stores key-value pairs in a sorted tree structure. Keys are sorted by their natural order or a custom comparator.            |
| `PriorityQueue`        | Implements the `Queue` interface and provides ordering of elements according to their natural order or a comparator. It does not allow null values.                      |
| `ArrayDeque`           | Implements the `Deque` interface and provides a resizable array-based double-ended queue. Supports adding/removing elements from both ends efficiently.                  |
| `Vector`               | A synchronized, resizable array. It is an older class that has largely been replaced by `ArrayList`.                                                                     |
| `Stack`                | A subclass of `Vector` that implements a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of objects. It is considered obsolete and is generally replaced by `Deque` for stack operations. |
| `HashTable`            | A synchronized map that does not allow null keys or values. It has been largely replaced by `ConcurrentHashMap` and `HashMap`.                                           |
| `ConcurrentHashMap`    | A thread-safe variant of `HashMap` that allows concurrent read and write operations without needing to lock the entire map.                                              |
| `CopyOnWriteArrayList` | A thread-safe variant of `ArrayList` where all mutative operations (like adding, removing elements) are performed by creating a new copy of the array.                   |

The above table provides a summary of the main classes in the Java Collections Framework.
